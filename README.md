Hello, and thank you for letting us join you on your machine learning journey, however far along that you may be! It doesn't matter if you don't come from a technical or a mathematical background (though it's okay if you do too!); we are releasing this training to help as many people as possible learn about machine learning and AI. We are very excited to be joining you in this journey üòä

#### Our Goal: provide practical experience in applied AI
- Provide a 12-week training with a capstone project
- Help with scoping, designing, implementing POC of AI project
- Provide guidance throughout the course
- Provide high-level ML knowledge and intuition
- Demystifying ML: from ‚Äúblack box‚Äù to real application

#### Your Goal: learn how to implement & troubleshoot AI solutions in 3 months
- Finish the course
- Finish the Capstone project

If you're looking for some inspirantion, here's a quote from Jeremy Howard, one of the co-founders of fast.ai

___‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen that the only consistent trait amongst every fast.ai student that‚Äôs gone on to be a world-class practitioner is that they are all very tenacious.‚Äù___

### Capstone
Congratulations on making all the way through the first eight weeks! Now you‚Äôre ready to build a cool project! 

Please note we are assuming you are comfortable coding in Python and setting up your dev environment (VS code). If you don't feel comfortable, please reach out to us.

We are providing you with two options you can choose from to create your capstone project.

#### Two options
1. __(Recommended)__ Use cognitive services to solve a problem of your choice (highly recommend going with CS. It will show how easy it is to build a solution)
    - You learned the basic understanding/intuition behind machine learning and want to quickly build a solution. Should be comfortable working with APIs.
2. Use fastai & datasets to solve a problem.
    - You will acquire more experience coding ML models from scratch, provide more flexibility tweaking your models, and understaning ‚Äúunder the hood‚Äù of ML models.

We encourage you to keep in mind the following three rules when approaching the capstone project:
1. Use Azure Cognitive Services (option 1) or fastai (option 2)
2. Define your use case (deadline by week 8)
3. Create something unique that hasn‚Äôt been done before

#### Guidelines
For the capstone project, your goal is to use what you learned throughout the first 8 weeks to create an unique solution that hasn‚Äôt been done before using AI. You have up to week 8 to come up with your use case. We will hold weekly office hours to answer questions you may have and guide you throughout your project.

Here are the possible steps you may want to consider:
1. Think about a use case or a problem you want to solve. Hopefully, something that hasn‚Äôt been done before.
2. Find/create a dataset that can be used to train an AI system to solve the problem.
3. Incorporate Azure Cognitive Services or fastai into training/deploying your model.
4. Reiterate and try to improve your model.

#### Potential ideas
- Create a computer vision system that recognizes your pets
- Create a resume parser using NLP
- Create a model that recognizes anomalies on images (e.g., X-ray images)
- Create a music recommendation system

Don‚Äôt worry if these ideas sound too daunting or difficult. By week 8, you should be able to know at least where to start. Also, we will be providing feedback and mentoring during the 
Capstone project. However, it is expected that you come up with your own use case.

Here‚Äôs some advice. Try to create the simplest model you can by the end of the first week and use the following weeks to iterate and improve your model. It‚Äôs easy to fall into the trap of trying to create something very complex and forget that a working model is better than no model at all.

Happy coding üòä
