Hello, and thank you for letting us join you on your machine learning journey, however far along that you may be! It doesn't matter if you don't come from a technical or a mathematical background (though it's okay if you do too!); we are releasing this training to help as many people as possible learn about machine learning and AI. We are very excited to be joining you in this journey üòä

#### Our Goal: provide practical experience in applied AI
- Provide a 12-week training with a capstone project
- Help with scoping, designing, implementing POC of AI project
- Provide guidance throughout the course
- Provide high-level ML knowledge and intuition
- Demystifying ML: from ‚Äúblack box‚Äù to real application

#### Your Goal: learn how to implement & troubleshoot AI solutions in 3 months
- Finish the course
- Finish the Capstone project
